classificationRationaleMd: "Agents are first-class participants in the documented plugin and CLI workflow: they configure a buyer-question benchmark, trigger an analysis, and retrieve the resulting records programmatically."
inclusionRationaleMd: "The product provides a substantive, documented measurement workflow for agent-led marketing and AI-search research rather than a generic API wrapper."
bestForMd: "Technical marketers and agent builders who need a repeatable, reviewable AI-search visibility benchmark instead of manual prompting and spreadsheet collection."
notBestForMd: "Teams seeking a conventional SEO suite, a passive real-time monitoring feed, or an autonomous publishing system."
limitationsMd: "Analyses consume credits and results reflect the configured questions, personas, and providers; review returned evidence before making marketing decisions. The privacy policy states that brand information, questions, and descriptions are shared with third-party AI services. Free results are public; paid results default to public unless made private through account settings. Account data is retained indefinitely while active; analytics data is retained indefinitely but may be replaced when analyses are regenerated. Deletion requests are handled within 30 days. The policy promises encryption in transit, not end-to-end encryption or a verified encryption-at-rest guarantee. See https://botsee.io/privacy."
unknownsMd: "No independent benchmark of accuracy, coverage, or cross-provider repeatability was reviewed for this listing."

BotSee is a hosted AI-visibility measurement tool with a Claude Code plugin and direct Python CLI for coding-agent workflows. It uses a repeatable site, customer-type, persona, and question structure, then returns structured data about competitors, keywords, cited sources, and AI responses.

## So agents can...

- build a defined buyer-question benchmark before running AI-search research
- run an analysis through the documented plugin or CLI and retrieve structured records
- inspect competitor mentions, keyword signals, cited sources, and raw responses before recommending a content or distribution action
